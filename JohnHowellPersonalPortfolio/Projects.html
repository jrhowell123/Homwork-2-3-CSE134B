            <header>Global Warming's Potential Correlation with Shark Attacks</header>
            <p> This project examines the relatedness of unprovoked shark attacks with rising sea level and ocean temperature. Our goal was to find evidence proving that our hypothesis 
                of there being a relationship between the two variables ocean temperature and sea level with shark attacks is true. Through the cleaning and analysis of two data sets, one 
                looking at the progression of the ocean, and the other at shark attacks, we discovered that there is indeed a positive correlation of sea level and ocean temperature with 
                shark attacks.</p>
            <h1>Resaerch Question</h1>
            <p>Is there a statistically significant correlation between rising ocean temperature and sea level with the frequency of unprovoked shark attacks in North America?</p>

        <header>Characterization of the Methane Seep Community at Lasuen Knoll</header>
        <p>MethaneSeeps are areas where reduced chemicals (methane and hydrogen sulfide) are 
            seeping out of the earth and hotspots of biological activity. This study undertakes the 
            investigation of Lasuen Knoll, a seep in the Southern California Borderland, the megafaunal 
            community structure including density, taxonomic composition, distribution, diversity and 
            lifestyles of the fauna will be fleshed out by comparing the active seep, transition, and 
            background environments. This project started with a cruise on the RV Falkor focused on 
            characterizing benthic biodiversity on different substrates in the Southern California Borderland. Then, post cruise analysis was done using stills and transects that were recorded on the dive at 
            Lasuen Knoll. In transect analysis, an organism that is labeled as solitary coral was most 
            abundant at roughly 8164. <i>Munidopsis girguisi</i> 
            <aside>
                <h1><i>Munidopsis girguisi</i></h1>
                <p>These crabs have chemosynthetic bacteria on their setae that are likely used 
                    as a food source for the arthropod. Since the crabs rely heavily on the source of methane, their 
                    abundance could give a sense of how much methane is being released at a given region within 
                    the seep</p>
            </aside> 
            was the second most abundant by count in the 
            transects at 61. Furthermore, <i>Iophon nr. methanophila sp</i>. sponge, <i>Munidopsis girguisi</i>, 
            folliculinid ciliate mat, and Solitary Coral were labeled as the overarching megafauna of the core 
            seep environment. After looking at the results, two major questions came up. First, are the <i>Munidopsis girguisi</i> with bacteria covered claws that live at the core seep environment a different 
            species than the <i>Munidopsis girguisi</i> found outside of the core seep area that do not show hairy 
            bacteria covered claws? Second, are the solitary coral color morph types different species or a 
            variation of the same species? In conclusion, Lasuen Knoll sets itself apart from the other seeps 
            of the Southern California Borderland due to its shallow location and the many unanswered questions 
            that still surround it.</p>
